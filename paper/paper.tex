\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (\nids{}) are software systems
that monitor the network traffic for malicious behavior and act
accordingly by blocking messages or alerting humans about suspicious
events~\cite{Mitchell:2014:SID:2597757.2542049}. \nids{} are typically
placed behind a firewall, vetting the traffic that the firewall did
not block. Various open-source (\eg{}, Snort~\cite{snort} and
Suricata~\cite{suricata}) and commercial \nids\ implementations (\eg{},
SolarWinds~\cite{solarwinds} and IBM QRadar~\cite{qradar}) exist
today. These systems are very popular in industry to secure local
computer networks given the amount of potential malicious traffic that
exist on the Internet.

This paper focuses on rule-based \nids{}, which is a very popular kind
of NIDS used in industry (see Section~\ref{sec:background}). A
\emph{rule-based intrusion detector}\footnote{\aka\ signature-based
  intrusion detector.} checks if the network traffic matches a fixed
set of rules. Figure~\ref{fig:synflood-example} shows an example rule
of Suricata~\cite{suricata}, a popular open-source \nids{}. This
particular rule prescribes a method to capture a denial-of-service
attack to a server by matching specific conditions about the network
traffic~\cite{understanding-dos}. Relevant properties about the
traffic of interest appear in bold in this rule (see
Section~\ref{sec:suri-metas-coverage}). Deployments of rule-based
\nids\ are restricted to a fixed set of rules defined by the network
system administrator. Updating these rules is tedious and error-prone,
but it is important as attackers constantly create new strategies to
circumvent existing rules. IT-security companies capitalize on this
phenomena and offer rulesets on the
market~\cite{proofpoint-etpro,snort-rule-subscriptions}.

This paper proposes \tname{}\footnote{Abbreviation for
  \textbf{Sy}nthesis of Su\textbf{ri}cata R\textbf{u}le\textbf{s}.}, a
technique that uses machine intelligence to automatically synthesize
rules for rule-based \nids. Our goal is to facilitate the creation
process of rules and, consequently, harden the protection of \nids\ to
network attacks. \tname{} synthesizes rules from malicious and benign
traffic and from examples of correct rules.

%% Note that anomaly-based \nids are evolving pretty quick with the
%% advances in machine learning, but rule-based \nids are still extremely
%% popular.  \tname{} could also leverage existing databases of malicious
%% traffic to synthesize rules.  Regardless of how the negative traffic
%% is produced (out of scope of this paper), those rules can be
%% distributed to rule databases for free.
%%  The
%% core motivation is that 1) attackers are productive in creating new
%% ways to circumvent existing protections and 2) manual creation of
%% rules is tedious and time-consuming.

\section{Network Intrusion Detection Systems (\nids)}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Rule-based and Anomaly-based \nids}

\sloppy \nids{} are typically categorized in two
groups~\cite{kumar2007survey}: rule-based (see
Section~\ref{sec:intro}) and anomaly-based \nids. An
\emph{anomaly-based intrusion detector} learn usage behavior from
benign traffic and, based on that, alert uncommon
behavior~\cite{7579764,kumar2007survey,Mitchell:2014:SID:2597757.2542049,cordy-etal-issta19}. More
precisely, an anomaly-based \nids{} flags an attack when the network
traffic manifests different characteristics compared to those of the
benign traffic.

Rule-based \nids\ can miss attacks as rulesets can become outdated
whereas anomaly-based \nids\ can report false alarms as learning
algorithms that generalize observations from bening traffic are
approximate. To sum up, rule-based \nids{} and anomaly-based \nids{}
are complementary---a rule-based \nids{} focuses on known attacks
whereas anomaly-based \nids{} focuses on unknown potential attacks.
This paper focuses on rule-based \nids\ for its tremendous popularity
in industry. Although we focused on the Suricata \nids, the principles
we used are general to any other signature-based \nids~(\eg{},
Snort~\cite{snort}).


\subsection{Suricata Rules}
\label{sec:example-suricata-rules}

Figure~\ref{fig:synflood-example} shows an example rule of
Suricata~\cite{suricata}, a popular open-source \nids{} maintained by
the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF)~\cite{oisf}. A
Suricata rule is divided in three parts---action, header, and rule
options~\cite{suri-rule-format}. The action part appears as the first
word in the rule description. An action denotes the task that needs to
be executed if the rule pattern is satisfied. In this example, a
message will be sent to system administrators if the rule pattern is
satisfied. The header comes after the action in the rule
description. It restricts the information flow covered by the
rule. For this rule, the header is \CodeIn{tcp \$HOME\_NET any ->
  \$EXTERNAL\_NET any}. It instructs Suricata to inspect \CodeIn{tcp}
traffic flowing from any port in the home network to any other address
outside the home network. The variables \CodeIn{\$HOME\_NET} and
\CodeIn{\$EXTERNAL\_NET} are configurable. The rule options come after
the header. It is a semi-colon-separated sequence of key-value
pairs. Rule options serve to document the analyzed traffic (\eg{},
``msg'', ``classtype'', and ``sid'') and to characterize the attack
pattern (\eg, ``flags'', ``threshold'', and ``content''). \tname{}
produces options of the second kind, which are \emph{relevant} to
capturing the attack.

\begin{table}[t!]
  \caption{\label{table:rules}Example options of Suricata.}  
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{clp{5.5cm}}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{\#} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Name} &  \multicolumn{1}{c}{Description}\\
    \midrule     
    1 & dsize & matches on the size of the packet payload\\
    2 & itype &  matches on a specific ICMP type\\
    3 & icode & matches on a specific ICMP code\\
    4 & icmp\_seq  & checks a ICMP sequence number\\
    5 & icmp\_id & matches on specific ICMP id-values\\
    6 & window & checks the size of the TCP window\\
    7 & flags & matches on TCP flags\\
    8 & fragbits & checks if the fragmentation or reserved bits are set in the IP header\\
    9 & threshold & controls the ruleâ€™s alert frequency\\
    10 & content & checks if argument is present on the payload\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}



Table~\ref{table:rules} shows a sample of the options of
Suricata. Column ``\#'' shows the option number, column ``Name'' shows
the name of the option, and column ``Description'' presents a short
description of the option purpose. We found that the option
\CodeIn{content} is particularly prevalent in rules from public
databases\MyComment{ (see Figure~\ref{fig:distribution-contents})}. This
option takes a sequence of bytes as argument (\eg{},
\CodeIn{content:''SELECT ''}) and checks if that sequence is present
in the payload of the message. Detailed description of the Suricata
rules can be found elsewhere~\cite{suri-rule-format}. It is worth
noting that Suricata supports a total of \totoptions\ distinct options
covering \numproto\ distinct protocols. A total of 9 of these options
are for documentation.\MyComment{For instance, the purpose of rule
  option \CodeIn{msg} is to print on the output an informative message
  indicating what kind of intrusion has been observed.}
Figure~\ref{fig:distribution-rules-protocol} shows the distributions
of these options per protocol. The sum of the number of protocol
options is higher than \totoptions\ as some options are shared across
different protocols. \tname{} does not make distinction among protocols.

\subsection{Rules and Packets}
\label{sec:rules-and-packets}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{figs/ICMP-packet-structure.png}
\caption{Layout of an ICMP packet.}
\label{fig:icmp-packet-layout}
\end{figure}

Rule options are often associated with specific fields of network
packets. Let's consider the ICMP protocol as an
example. Figure~\ref{fig:icmp-packet-layout} shows the layout of an
ICMP packet. The packet fields ``Flags'' and ``Time to Live'',
declared in the IP header, are mapped to the options \CodeIn{flagbits}
and \CodeIn{ttl}, respectively. Likewise, the fields ``Type'' and
``Code'', declared in the ICMP header, are mapped to the options
\CodeIn{itype} and \CodeIn{icode}. (Table~\ref{table:rules} lists some
example rule options.) The values of the options ``ttl'', ``itype'',
and ``icode'' are the same as the value of the corresponding fields in
the ICMP packet. For the field ``Flags'' the value of the
corresponding option is encoded in the bitvector. For example, if the
``Flags'' field stores the value 1010, the corresponding rule option
will be \CodeIn{flagbits:RM}, as each position of the vector encodes a
different character in the \CodeIn{flagbits} rule option. The value of
several options can be determined through transformation functions, as
those described above. One expection to this is the option
\CodeIn{threshold}, which is typically used in denial-of-service
attacks. That option operates over sequence of messages as opposed to
a single message. Consequently, it is not possible to determined its
values from a single message. More precisely, to trigger an action on
a rule containing that option a \nids\ tool needs to monitor several
messages.

\section{Illustrative Examples}
\label{sec:suri-metas-coverage}

This section briefly presents examples of attacks and illustrates the
rules that \tname{} synthesizes to capture those attacks.


\subsection{Denial-of-Service}
\label{sec:dos}

The SYN Flood attack is a denial-of-service attack that exploits a vulnerability in the TCP/IP handshake
to establish a TCP connection~\cite{cloudfare-synflood}. The handshake
works as follows in normal circumstances. First, a client sends a SYN
packet to the server, requesting a connection. Second, the server
responds with a SYN-ACK packet to the client. Third, the client
responds with an ACK message and the connection is established. Aware
of the protocol, an attacker sends multiple SYN packets to different
ports of a server, often using fake IP addresses. Then, after the
server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, the client keeps sending other
SYN packets to avoid the connection to time out. Without proper
protection, the server accepts these malicious requests and eventually
legitimate requests cannot be satisfied due to resource exhaustion.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \lstinputlisting[language=C,numbers=none,keywords={flags,threshold}]{synflood.suricata}
  \caption{Suricata rule for SYN Flood Attacks.}
  \label{fig:synflood-example}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:synflood-example} shows a Suricata rule that captures
this attack. This rule was obtained from the Emerging Threats Open
Ruleset~\cite{emerging-threats-open}. The relevant options in the
rule appear in bold---the option \CodeIn{flags: S,12}, identifies a
SYN packet in a TCP packet and the option \CodeIn{threshold: type
  both, track by\_dst, count 5000, seconds 5} indicates that a high
volume of such packets should be requested in a short period of time.

In the following, we illustrate how \tname{} proceeds for obtaining
the rule for the SYN Flood attack. The challenge in synthesizing rules
is to discover the set of options in a rule that makes the \nids\ to
capture the malicious traffic, but allow the benign traffic to go
through.  The other parts of the rule (\ie{}, the action and the
header) are either inferred or left constant. For example, in this
case, \tname{} sets the action header to \CodeIn{alert} and sets the
header to \CodeIn{<proto> any any -> any any}, indicating that it
infers the target protocol and uses the most general flow description
possible, \ie{}, it instructs the \nids\ to analyze the traffic
flowing from/to any address and port.  We understand that this is
domain-specific information and assume that the system administrator
would know how to customize it.

\tname{} proceeds as follows to synthesize rules for this
attack. First, it analyzes the positive (\ie, malicious) traffic and
extracts options expressed in that traffic. In this case, the
malicious traffic is characterized as a sequence of 20
messages. \tname{} finds the following set of options at this stage:

\noindent
\tname{} only reports a rule if the \nids\ instantiated with that rule
is able to capture the traffic passed on input. Consequently, by
construction, a rule that uses this set of options captures the
malicious traffic. Unfortunately, this rule is potentially
overspecified. Informally, the rule includes ``too specific''
characteristics of the malicious traffic and could potentially result
in false negatives. For example, in this particular case, note that
the option \CodeIn{windows: 64} is not included in the golden rule
from Figure~\ref{fig:synflood-example}.

Second, \tname{} uses negative (\ie{}, benign) traffic to mitigate the
overfitting issue. In this step, \tname{} searches for alternative
rules that preserves the invarianxt that a rule should capture the
positive traffic but not capture the negative traffic. It uses the
rule obtained in the previous step, containing three options, to
bootstrap the search for rules. The search generates rules containing
subsets of the options from the seed rule.

Finally, \tname{} ranks the inferred rules according to heuristics
extracted from a database of existing rules. One example heuristic
function we used to rank the generated rules was
\Fix{...elaborate...}. The list below shows the rule options for the
top-5 rules \tname{} produces for this attack.

\Mar{listem 5 primeira regras neste caso}

To sum up, \tname{} uses the messages that manifest an attack in the
first step (to create an overspecific seed rule), benign traffic in
the second step (to create a set of plausible rules from the seed
rule), and existing rules from popular sources in the third step (to
rank the generated rules).

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent
\textbf{Differences.}~Note that there are differences between the
options produced in the first step of \tname{} and the options from
the golden rule, as per Figure~\ref{fig:synflood-example}. The option
\CodeIn{flags} does not mention parameters \CodeIn{1 2}, there is an
extra option \CodeIn{window}, and there are differences in the option
\CodeIn{threshold}. Considering the option \CodeIn{flags}, the first
parameter of that option indicates what flags in the packet must be
set while the second parameter indicates non-mandatory flags (\ie{},
``don't cares''). The option \CodeIn{flags: S} indicates that the flag
``S'' must be set and all flags not mentioned (``1'' and ``2'', in our
case) must be unset for the \nids\ to capture the
traffic. Consequently, that choice of option alone could result in
false negatives and false positives. An attack that satisfies all
other conditions in a rule and have flags ``1'' or ``2'' set would be
captured by the original rule but not the inferred rule---a case of
false negative. Likewise, an attack that satisfies all conditions and
have flags ``1'' and ``2'' unset would be captured by the inferred
rule but not the original rule---a case of false positive. The set of
positive examples is to blame in this case. To mitigate this issue,
the input messages should have covered cases with options ``1'' or
``2'' set. Considering option \CodeIn{windows: 64}, \tname{} is able
to generate rules without that option, as discussed above. Considering
option \CodeIn{threshold}, the values used in the golden rule are
domain-specific. \tname{} uses default values for these options. We
conjecture that the system administrator would be able to configure
this option.

Active reconnaissance is a method used by malicious individuals to
collect information about a computing system to determine potential
vulnerabilities. Active reconnaissance is a preliminary step towards
an actual attack. For example, Ping Scan is a very common type of
attack that scans the network for IPs of accessible hosts. An attacker
sends several ICMP Echo requests to a range of IP addresses in the
network and checks which ones respond to the requests. This allow the
attacker to know which machines are active in the network. Then (s)he
can choose one of them to attack.

Figure 4 shows a Suricata rule that captures a reproduction of a Ping
Scan attack available from NMAP~\cite{netmap}, a network discovery and
security auditing open-source tool. The relevant options are in
bold---the option \CodeIn{dsize: 0} indicates that the packet has no
bytes in the payload and the option \CodeIn{itype: 8} indicates that
the packet to be captured are ICMP Echo requests.

Again, to synthesize rules for a Ping Scan, \tname{} analyzes the
positive malicious traffic and extracts the following rule options:

\section{Technique}

\tname{} is a technique to synthesize rules for signature-based
\nids~(\eg{}, Snort~\cite{snort} and Suricata~\cite{suricata}). The
goal is to create rules that capture \emph{only} the
malicious traffic.

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Overview.}~To create rules, \tname\ leverages (1)
benign and malicious network traffic and (2) rules from public
rulesets. \tname\ takes on input malicious and benign traffic and a
set of rules from public rulesets and produces on output a list of
plausible rules to isolate the malicious
traffic. Figure~\ref{fig:overview} shows the workflow of \tname{} as a
pipeline of three components, which appear numbered in the figure.
The inputs of the technique appear at the bottom of the figure whereas
the output appears at the right.

\tname\ works as follows. First, it produces a potentially
overspecified rule that captures the malicious traffic, provided on
input in the form of pcap files~\cite{pcap}. In this step,
\tname\ detects rule options in correspondence with the input messages
(see Section~\ref{sec:rules-and-packets}). It is worth noting that the
rule produced in this step can include more options than the golden
rule (see Section~\ref{sec:suri-metas-coverage}). Consequently, the
use of that rule could lead, in principle, to false negatives as not
all manifestations of the same attack are identical. Second, \tname{}
generates plausible rules similar to the one produced in the previous
step. It is worth noting that any subset of the original set of
options captures the malicious traffic. As the generation procedure
discards options from the initial rule, it satisfies the invariant of
capturing malicious traffic by construction. However, the goal of
\tname\ is to produce rules that capture \emph{only} malicious
traffic. To achieve that goal, \tname{} uses benign traffic from
public databases to check that the \nids\ instantiated with a given
rule does not capture benign traffic. The minimization step uses a
population-based gradient descent-like search to find all plausible
rules, which are derived from the rule obtained in the previous
step. Third, uses several heuristic functions derived from a dataset
of rules to rank the rules generated in the previous step.



%% The goal of the first
%% component is to produce a rule that captures the negative traffic.
%% First, it initializes the rule with random values. Only options
%% associated with the used protocol are included in the rule
%% representation. Then, \tname\ optimizes the rule options until
%% \suri\ is able to capture the attack associated with the negative
%% traffic.  \tname\ unsuccessfully terminates at this point if it cannot
%% capture the attack. The second component takes as input the rule
%% produced by the first component and tries to minimize that rule. Note
%% that any subset of options would capture the negative traffic---as all
%% options in the rule need to be satisfied for the negative traffic to
%% be captured---but it can also capture positive traffic. This component
%% systematically discards options from the rule encoding until no
%% positive traffic is captured.



\subsection{Step 1: Reverse Engineering}

The goal of the first step is to extract options from the positive
traffic, which is characterized with pcap files~\cite{pcap}, a popular
format to describe network packets.

For that, \tname{} parses the message looking for options associated
with the data. As described in Section~\ref{sec:rules-and-packets},
there is a correspondence between packet fields and rule
options. \tname{} leverages that mapping to infer options. The
examples of sections~\ref{sec:dos} and~\ref{sec:active-recon} show
cases where \tname{} infers options with this mapping. Unfortunately,
inferring options at the field granularity level is insufficient to
capture \CodeIn{content} options as the described on
Section~\ref{sec:content-example}. These options refer to parts of the
payload of the message and cannot be extracted directly from the
fields. Handling this case is critically important as 93\% of
the rules contain \CodeIn{content} options.

Figure~\ref{fig:distribution-contents} shows the histogram of the
number of these options per rule obtained from a public
ruleset~\cite{emerging-threats-open} containing 27.8K Suricata
rules. We limited the number of content options per rule to 10 for
space. Rules without \CodeIn{content} options is an exception
(7\%) and half of the rules contain at least two
\CodeIn{content} options.  To find the values associated with these
options, \tname{} splits the payload of the malicious message in
tokens using natural language delimiters, such as $\backslash$t,
$\backslash$n, $\backslash$r, and spaces. We observed, by inspecting
existing rules, that \CodeIn{content} options typically refer to
sequence of characters in the payload of messages separated by these
delimiters. This tokenization step can generate dozens of options.
\tname{} produced a total of \Fix{xx} content options for the example
Section~\ref{sec:content-example}. 


\subsection{Step 2: Rule Minimization}
\label{sec:minimization}

The rule reported in the first step satisfies the criterion to only
capture positive traffic. Unfortunately, that rule is overconstrained.
The rule can include options that are irrelevant for the input
message. Consequently, the \nids\ may be unable to capture a different
manifestation of the same attack.

%%  Some options added to the rule
%% during the first step are irrelevant for determining the attack and
%% should be removed to obtain more general rules. 

\tname{} leverages public datasets~\cite{tcpreplay} of benign traffic
to guide the search for more general rules, hence addressing the
overffiting issue. To that end, \tname{} \emph{minimizes} the rules
produced in the previous step, preserving the invariant of \emph{only}
capturing the positive malicious traffic. We say that a rule is
minimal if discarding any option results in capturing negative (\ie{},
benign) traffic.  The minimization procedure we propose in this step
builds on the observation that all options from the rule produced in
the previous step are satisifed by the positive traffic. Consequently,
any subset of these options also captures the positive traffic. The
procedure iteratively discards options from the candidate rule until
it detects that the rule is minimal, \ie{}, it finds that no other
option can be removed. The procedure uses negative traffic to guide
the search.

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{algo1} shows the pseudocode of the \tname{}
minimization algorithm. The algorithm takes as input the
overconstrained rule produced by the reverse engineering step and
produces a set $\mathcal R$ of minimized rules. Line~\ref{line-init}
initializes the set $\mathcal{R}$ of candidate solutions with the seed
rule $sr$. We encode a rule as a bitvector where each index in the
vector represents one option; the value assigned at a given position
indicates whether or not the option is present in the rule. Each
iteration of the outer loop
(lines~\ref{start-do-while}-\ref{end-do-while}) represents one
generation of the population of individuals produced by the
search. The algorithm terminates when no rule in the current
generation of individuals could be further reduced without violating
the property that a candidate solution should only capture positive
traffic. This means that execution of one iteration has not reached
the statement declared at line~\ref{line-progress}, which adds an
element to the set $\mathcal{R'}$. Consequently, that set will be
empty at the end of one iteration of the outer
loop. Line~\ref{init-rprime} initializes the new generation of
candidate rules. The inner loop
(lines~\ref{start-foreach}--\ref{end-foreach}) iterates through each
candidate rule in $\mathcal R$. Note that these rules have been found
in the previous generation. The algorithm mutates each of these rules
for $N$ times, discarding one option of the rule each time. The call
to $\mathit{isNew}$ checks if $r$ has not been previously generated
through another path whereas the call to $\mathit{isPlausible}$ checks
if the rule only captures positive traffic. Function $\mathit{copy}$
creates a copy of the bitvector of a rule, function $\mathit{len}$
returns the length of the vector, and function $\mathit{rand}$
randomly chooses one index of the vector.

Note that no rules are produced in the last iteration of the
algorithm. Minimal rules are produced in the second-to-last
iteration. In the other iterations, intermediate rules are
produced. Conceptually, the search induces a search tree with the seed
rule $sr$ as the root, minimal rules as child nodes, and intermediate
rules as internal nodes. The edges of the tree denote the ancestor
relation between two rules. Note also that the algorithm reports every
rule in the tree instead of only minimal rules. The reason is that the
correct rule may be non-minimal. In summary, this algorithm reports
many rules that are plausible by using benign traffic to minimize an
overconstrained rule that is focused on the malicious traffic. In the
following step, \tname{} ranks the rules this algorithm reports by
their similarity with previous rules.



\begin{theorem}
  The minimization algorithm computes rules that capture only
  the positive traffic.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Every rule created during the search captures the positive traffic
  as every rule contains a proper subset of the option from the
  original rule and all those options are satisfied by the positive
  traffic. By definition of function $\mathit{isPlausible}$, these rules
  also capture \emph{only} the positive traffic. If some negative
  traffic was captured, a rule would not be added to $\mathcal
  R'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  The minimization algorithm may not produce minimal rules.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The output of the minimization algorithm may contain rules that are
not minimal given the non-determinism of the algorithm. In principle,
it is possible that options that could be discarded are not selected
in the loop from lines~\ref{start-for}--\ref{end-for}. However, we
found empirically that a small value of $N$ suffices to discard those
options from a rule.
\end{proof}

%% Public databases of negative traffic with
%% \Fix{thousands} of messages exist  and can be used to
%% increase the accuracy of the minimization.
%\subsection{Limitations}
%\Fix{...}

\vspace{2ex}
\noindent\textbf{Limitation.} It is worth noting that although
\tname{} is accurate for generating rules that discrimate positive and
negative traffic, the quality of these rules is limited by the quality
of the training data it uses. For the positive traffic, \tname{} only
requires one sample, but can benefit of several samples as the example
from Section~\ref{sec:dos} illustrated. The same applies for the
negative traffic. In this case, however, \tname{} can use public
datasets available online.

\vspace{2ex}
\noindent\textbf{Implementation details.} We implemented function
\emph{isPlausible} by 1)~updating Suricata to only use the rule that
is passed as parameter to this function, 2)~replaying the negative
traffic (see Section~\ref{sec:dataset-benign}), and 3)~reading the
Suricata logs to check if any benign message was captured by the
rule. It is worth noting that the benign traffic is stored in ``pcap''
files~\cite{pcap} and Suricata can process those files very
efficiently compared to analyzing network messages directly.

\subsection{Step 3: Ranking}

\tname{} uses a composition of heurisitc functions to sort the rules
it produces. Each function uses a different criterion to estimate how
similar a rule, created in the previous step, is to existing Suricata
rules~\cite{emerging-threats-open}. We describe in the following each
of these heuristic functions. Each function $f_i$ ranges in the 0-1
domain. \tname{} uses the weighted average of these functions to sort
rules: $\sum{f_i}/|f_i|$.

\subsubsection{Size of a rule}
\tname{} uses the size of existing rules as one element to measure
similarity. Informally, rules with popular sizes score high; inpopular
rules score low. 

Figure~\ref{fig:distribution-rule-size} shows the histogram of rule
sizes for our rule dataset, including a total of
\numrulessuri\ rules. The x-axis shows the number of options included
in a rule and the y-axis shows the number of rules with the
corresponding number of options. For example, we noted that most rules
have 2 to 6 options. Based on that, \tname{} values rules in that size
range higher compared to other sizes.

%\tname{} uses this information to rank rules.

  }
  \vspace{-2ex}
  \caption{\label{fig:distribution-rule-size}Distribution of rule
    size.\Mar{how is it possible a rule with 0 options?}}
\end{figure}



More precisely, we calculate the contribution of size of a given rule
$r$ with the following formula:

\[\frac{\mathit{rules\_per\_size}[\mathit{len(r)}]}{\mathit{num\_rules}}\]

\noindent
, where $\mathit{len(r)}$ denotes the number of options of a rule $r$,
$\mathit{rules\_per\_size}$ encodes the size distribution--it is a
dictionary mapping the number of rules associated with a given size,
and $\mathit{num\_rules}$ returns the number of elements in the
dictionary. Consequently, the contribution of size is proportion;al to
its popularity. For example, the contribution of this heuristic for a
rule with 3 options would be 0.145 (=3,662/25,239) whereas the
contribution of a rule with 9 options would be 0.03 (=763/25,239).

\section{Evaluation}

This section evaluates the precision and efficiency of \tname{}.

\subsection{Objects of Analysis}

Table~\ref{table:attacks} shows the attacks we analyzed and the
options of the rule from the Emerging Threats Open
Ruleset~\cite{emerging-threats-open} that captures the attack. Column
``Name'' shows the name of the attack, column ``Protocol'' shows the
protocol name, and column ``Ground Truth'' shows the options of the
rule that captures the attack.

\subsection{Dataset of Benign Traffic}
\label{sec:dataset-benign}

Note from Figure~\ref{fig:overview} that the positive traffic is an
input to the technique. The negative non-malicious traffic, however,
is not. \tname{} uses public databases storing different kinds of
positive traffic for all protocols covered by Suricata. We used two
datasets of positive traffic. The Bigflows.pcap dataset is part of the
TcpReplay~\cite{tcpreplay} open source project. This dataset includes
real network traffic on a busy private network access point to the
Internet. According to the TcpReplay web site ``This capture is much
larger and has a smaller average packet size than the previous capture
(smallFlows.pcap). It also has many more flows and different
applications.''. In addition to the Bigflows.pcap dataset, we also
used datasets of normal traffic made available by Stratosphere
Lab~\cite{stratosphere-normal}.

\subsection{Methodology}

\tname{} expects (a) message(s) reproducing an attack on input. As
previously discussed, those messages could be directly provided by an
anomaly-based \nids\ tool. To evaluate \tname{}, however, we created
those messages ourselves. For all attacks listed on
Table~\ref{table:attacks}, we found reproduction scripts available on
the web. With the script to reproduce the attack, we proceeded as
follows: 1)~we instantiated the script on a given target machine,
2)~we executed the script, 3)~we monitored the traffic with the
wireshark network monitor~\cite{wireshark-net-monitor}, and 4) we
simulated the delivery of the corresponding network messages by
directly executing Suricata on the ``pcap'' files that wireshark
produced in the previous step. It is worth noting that Suricata is
invoked multiple times in the process of minimizing the rule (see
Section~\ref{sec:minimization}) and that processing pcap files is much
more efficient compared to sending and processing network messages. To
illustrate, the SYN Flood attack was reproduced with the hping3
tool~\cite{hping3} using the following command \CodeIn{hping3 -d 80 -w
  64 -S -p 80 --flood --rand-source <IP>}.

%% \Gui{We are using the bigflows.pcap provided by tcpreplay on http://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/captures.html "This is a capture of real network traffic on a busy private networkâ€™s access point to the Internet"
%%  }

%% \Luc{entrada: utilizamos a ferramenta hping3 para executar o ataque em um alvo arbitrario dentro da rede (n ha necessidade de haver um alvo real para executar o hping3) e capturamos o trafego gerado com o wireshark. o comando utilizado foi:\\*
%% \texttt{\# hping3 -d 80 -w 64 -S -p 80 --flood --rand-source 192.138.1.115} \\*
%% que envia pacotes de 80 bytes (-d 80), com a flag SYN habilitada (-S), tamanho de janela de 64 bytes (-w 64), direcionados a porta 80 (-p 80). A flag --flood indica q o hping3 vai enviar os pacotes o mais rÃ¡pido possÃ­vel. a flag --rand-source indica que cada pacote vai ter um ip de origem aleatorio. 192.138.1.115 Ã© o alvo.\\*
%% O trafego armazenado contem 40 mil pacotes SYN, enviados no intervalo de 1 segundo,  pegamos uma amostra de 20 desses pacotes para representar o flood e servir como entrada.\\*
%% O wireshark armazena os pacotes no formato pcap, utilizamos a ferramenta tcpreplay para reproduzir o trafego com o comando:\\*
%% \texttt{\# tcpreplay --pps 200 --intf1=wlp2s0 Datasets/syn-flood-sample.pcap}\\*
%% Nesse caso, estamos enviando os pacotes armazenados em \texttt{Datasets/syn-flood-sample.pcap} a uma taxa de 200 pacotes por segundo (\texttt{-pps 200}) utilizando a interface wlp2s0 (\texttt{--intf1 wlp2s0})\\* 
%% HÃ¡ diferenÃ§as entre os pacotes na opÃ§Ã£o ack.\\* 
%% Por que 20? Apenas para gerar a regra mais rapidamente, poderia ser qualquer valor maior ou menor. No final, o parÃ¢metro \texttt{count} da opÃ§Ã£o \texttt{threshold} vai ser alterado pelo adm da rede.\\*
%% Intervalo de reproduÃ§Ã£o: 0.005 segundo
